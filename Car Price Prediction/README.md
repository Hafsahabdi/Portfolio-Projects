# 🚗 Car Price Prediction

This project uses regression models to predict car prices based on various vehicle features.

## Summary
- Cleaned and explored car dataset (Mileage, Cylinder, Liter, Cruise).
- Built a Linear Regression model (initial R² = -0.167).
- Added categorical variables (Make, Trim) using one-hot encoding.
- Improved model accuracy to R² = 0.97.
- Used Ridge and Lasso for regularization.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
