# 🏠 House Price Prediction Using Regression

This project builds a regression-based machine learning model to predict house prices using data from the `kc_house_data.csv` dataset. The dataset includes features like house size, number of bedrooms, location, and condition ratings.

## 📊 Summary

This project walks through the process of data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and improvement using regularization techniques.

### 1. 🧹 Data Exploration & Preprocessing
- Loaded and examined key features from `kc_house_data.csv`.
- Used a correlation heatmap to identify important predictors.
- One-hot encoded the `zipcode` column, resulting in **76 total features**.
- Split data into 80% training and 20% testing sets using `train_test_split()`.

### 2. 🤖 Model Development
- Trained a **Linear Regression** model on the selected features.
- Evaluated the model using unseen test data.

### 3. 📈 Model Evaluation
- **R² Score**: 0.6522 (model explains ~65.2% of price variance)
- **RMSE**: \$194,340
- **MAE**: \$109,983

### 4. 🛠 Regularization Techniques
- Applied **Ridge**, **Lasso**, and **ElasticNet** to reduce overfitting.
- Regularization added penalties to large coefficients, improving model generalization.

### 5. 💡 Key Insights & Future Improvements
- The baseline linear regression model performed moderately but showed high error.
- Future improvements could include:
  - Advanced feature engineering and outlier detection.
  - Testing non-linear models (e.g., **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**).
  - Hyperparameter tuning for regularization models.
